# Image Placeholders

This directory is for storing images for the Travel website. Since this is a demo project, you'll need to add your own images to make the website look complete.

## Required Images

### Banner Images

Place these in the `banners` directory:

1. `hero-banner.jpg` - Main hero banner for the homepage (recommended size: 1920x600px)
2. `promo-banner.jpg` - Banner for the special offers page (recommended size: 1920x400px)

### Destination Images

Place these in the `destinations` directory:

## Image Sources

For a real project, ensure you have the rights to use any images. For testing purposes, you can use:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - Free high-quality stock photos
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - Free images and royalty-free stock

## Adobe Target Testing

When implementing A/B tests with Adobe Target, you might want to create alternative versions of these images to test different visual approaches. For example:

- Different hero banners with varying messaging
- Different destination images that emphasize various aspects (beaches vs. culture)
- Different promotional banners with alternate offers

Store these alternative images with clear naming conventions to easily identify them in your Adobe Target activities.
